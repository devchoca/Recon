``Recon`` is all about making computing and exploring economic models easier. It is meant as a teaching tool for professors and as a way to deeper the understanding of undergrads. 

Here, as an example, we'll use functions ``grid2()`` and ``cobb_douglas_2()`` in combination with ploting tools from the package ``plot3D`` to visualize utility levels and indiference curves.

```{R}
library(Recon)
library(plot3D)

consumption_set = grid2()

```
