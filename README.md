# Recon
Development of the Recon R package

This package aims to provide undergraduate students and teachers realiable ways of computing and exploring canonical models in economics. 

So far, the package covers:

* Steady state solution to the model presented in Solow (1956)
* Steady state solution to the model presented in Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992)
* Computes Cobb-Douglas functions with 2 inputs
* Cost functions
* Demand Curves
* Grid generating function, so one can map results easily. 


Things that are currently under work:

* Solution to a Cournot Duopoly
* Computing Cobb-Douglas functions with $n$-inputs
