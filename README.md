# Recon - Economics with R

This package aims to provide undergraduate students and teachers realiable ways of computing and exploring canonical models in economics. 

So far, the package covers:

* Steady state solution to the model presented in Solow (1956)
* Steady state solution to the model presented in Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992)
* Computing Cobb-Douglas functions with 2 inputs
* Computing Cobb-Douglas functions with $n$-inputs
* Grid generating function, so one can map results easily
* Finds the Pure Strategies Nash Equilibrium of a 2 person simultaneous game 
* Finds the Mixed Strategies Nash Equilibrium of a 2 person simultaneous game, for 2x2 pay-off matrices
* Equilibrium in a Cournot Duopoly Model, with linear and non-linear cost and demand curves

Things that are currently under work:

* Solution to a Stackelberg Duopoly Model
* Solution to a Bertrand Duopoly Model with differentiated goods
